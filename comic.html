 THE CHOSEN ONE – FULL ORIGIN STORY
    </p><p>
Daksh was just an ordinary boy, excited for a fun trip with friends and family. But something strange began happening as he arrived at the destination. Every night, he was haunted by dreams—a mystical, glowing figure calling out to him. When he followed the visions deep into the forest, an ancient symbol appeared in front of him, speaking:
“You are the Chosen One. But before power, comes suffering.”
</p><p>
Confused, Daksh returned to enjoy the trip. But fate struck. A sudden accident left him shattered—4 bones broken, 2 fingers crushed, and 3 ribs fractured. Strangely, no one else was harmed. As he lay in the hospital, something miraculous happened. His body began to heal at an unnatural speed. Within weeks, Daksh was stronger than ever. His muscles grew, his reflexes sharpened. His first power had awakened: Regeneration.
</p><p>
But healing was just the start.
</p><p>
One day, while touching an injured plant, Daksh noticed he could channel his energy to heal it. But when focusing too hard, the flower withered and died. That’s when he realized — he could take life force as well as give it.
</p><p>
Next, his body started adapting. Days would pass without him eating or drinking, yet he felt no hunger. He discovered his body could absorb nutrition directly from the environment. However, mastering it fully would take time.
</p><p>
As days passed, strange phenomena began happening around him. Objects would slide slightly when he focused on them. With training, Daksh learned he could move solid objects using telekinesis. Slowly, he extended this ability to fluids — controlling the flow of water and even bending the air.
</p><p>
But then, his vision changed. He no longer needed his glasses; his sight had evolved. Light itself could now bend to his will. Even though his glasses were no longer required, Daksh kept wearing them. They weren’t just for vision anymore — they were a part of him.
</p><p>
Next came gravity. Daksh found that he could manipulate gravitational forces, allowing him to float, glide, and eventually fly. Every power felt like pieces of a puzzle falling into place.
</p><p>
Then, a chilling realization struck him — his life force wasn’t depleting. He had stopped aging. He could feel the flow of time itself. The final piece clicked: Lifesteal — the ability to drain or give age, vitality, and life.
</p><p>
But it wasn’t over.
</p><p>
Daksh then unlocked Electricity Manipulation, being able to generate and discharge currents through his body. His environment responded — machines flickered, and bolts cracked from his fingers.
</p><p>
Finally, came the ultimate power — Energy Conversion. Daksh discovered that he could convert any form of energy into another. Heat into light, kinetic into electrical, sound into force. However, the price was clear: he could only use the energy he himself had created.
</p><p>
One night, while meditating, a whisper echoed in his mind:
These are the powers of the Chosen One
</p><p>

Realizing the gravity of this, Daksh trained day and night. Coordinating his powers with pcision, blending them into perfect harmony. But as his strength grew, his relationships changed. His parents and friends noticed a shift — Daksh was no longer the same boy. He was evolving into something beyond human.
</p><p>
And thus, the journey of The Chosen One began. Not just as a protector of Earth, but as a force who would soon face threats beyond imagination.
</p>
